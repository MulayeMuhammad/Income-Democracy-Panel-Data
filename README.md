## 📋 Project Overview

This project replicates and extends the seminal work of **Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Yared (2008)** on the relationship between per capita income and democracy. Using advanced panel data econometric techniques, we investigate whether there exists a causal relationship between economic development and democratization.

**Key Question**: Does income cause democracy, or is the positive correlation driven by omitted historical and institutional factors?

## 🎯 Research Objectives

1. **Replicate** the findings of Acemoglu et al. (2008) using panel data methods
2. **Investigate** the causal relationship between income and democracy
3. **Apply** advanced econometric techniques:
   - Pooled OLS
   - Fixed Effects (Within Estimator)
   - Anderson-Hsiao IV Estimator
   - Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)
4. **Test** model validity using:
   - Arellano-Bond autocorrelation test
   - Hansen-Sargan test for overidentifying restrictions

## 📊 Data Description

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Time Period**: 1950-2000 (5-year intervals)
- **Countries**: 211 countries
- **Observations**: 11 time periods per country
- **Total Observations**: 2,321

### Variables

| Variable | Description | Source |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `democracy` | Freedom House Political Rights Index (normalized 0-1) | Freedom House |
| `income` | Log GDP per capita | Maddison Tables (2003) + PPP estimates |
| `country` | Country identifier | - |
| `year` | Time period (5-year intervals) | - |

**Democracy Index (Freedom House)**:
- Evaluates: Electoral freedom, political parties, minority participation, effective opposition
- Scale: 0 (no democracy) to 1 (perfect democracy)

**Income Measure**:
- Two sources combined for robustness:
  - Long-term series: Maddison Tables (2003)
  - Recent estimates: Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted

## 🔬 Methodology

### Econometric Model

The dynamic panel data model is specified as:

```
d_it = α·d_i,t-1 + γ·y_i,t-1 + X'_i,t-1·β + μ_t + δ_i + u_it
```

Where:
- `d_it`: Democracy level in country i at time t
- `d_i,t-1`: Lagged democracy (captures persistence)
- `y_i,t-1`: Lagged log income per capita (main variable of interest)
- `X_i,t-1`: Vector of control variables
- `μ_t`: Time fixed effects (global trends)
- `δ_i`: Country fixed effects (time-invariant factors)
- `u_it`: Error term

### Estimation Strategies

#### 1. **Pooled OLS** (Baseline)
- Simple benchmark estimation
- **Bias**: Positive bias due to correlation between lagged dependent variable and error term
- **Coefficient (democracy lag)**: 0.7064*** (SE: 0.0243)
- **Coefficient (income lag)**: 0.0723*** (SE: 0.0083)

#### 2. **Fixed Effects (Within Estimator)**
- Controls for time-invariant country characteristics
- **Bias**: Negative bias (Nickell bias) due to lagged dependent variable
- **Coefficient (democracy lag)**: 0.3786*** (SE: 0.0334)
- **Coefficient (income lag)**: 0.0104 (SE: 0.0264) - **NOT SIGNIFICANT**
- **Key Finding**: Income effect disappears once fixed effects are included!

#### 3. **Anderson-Hsiao IV Estimator**
- Uses first differences to eliminate fixed effects
- Instruments: 2-period lagged levels
- **Coefficient (democracy lag)**: 0.4687*** (SE: 0.1182)
- **Coefficient (income lag)**: -0.1036 (SE: 0.3049) - NOT SIGNIFICANT
- Consistent but not efficient

#### 4. **GMM (Arellano-Bond)**
- Most efficient estimator under no serial correlation
- Uses all available moment conditions
- **Coefficient (democracy lag)**: 0.5050*** (SE: 0.0905)
- **Coefficient (income lag)**: -0.0901 (SE: 0.0803) - NOT SIGNIFICANT
- **AR(2) Test**: p-value = 0.3988 (no autocorrelation ✓)
- **Hansen Test**: χ² = 70.745, df = 44, p = 0.0064 (overidentification restrictions valid)

## 📈 Key Results

### Main Findings

1. **Cross-Sectional Analysis**: 
   - Strong positive correlation between income and democracy (see Figure 1)
   - Coefficient suggests 10% increase in GDP → 0.007 increase in Freedom House score

2. **Panel Data with Fixed Effects**:
   - ⚠️ **The relationship disappears!**
   - Once country-specific factors are controlled, income has NO significant effect on democracy
   - Result is robust across different estimation methods

3. **Dynamic Persistence**:
   - Democracy shows strong persistence (α ≈ 0.38 to 0.71)
   - Countries tend to maintain their democratic levels over time

4. **Causal Interpretation**:
   - **No evidence of causal effect** of income on democracy
   - Positive correlation likely due to omitted historical and institutional factors
   - Historical trajectories shape both economic and political development

### Statistical Tests

| Test | Statistic | p-value | Interpretation |
|------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| AR(2) - Arellano-Bond | 0.8437 | 0.3988 | No second-order autocorrelation ✓ |
| Hansen J-test | χ² = 70.745 (df=44) | 0.0064 | Overidentification restrictions valid |

## 📊 Results Visualization

### Figure 1: Cross-Sectional Relationship (1999)

The scatter plot shows a clear positive relationship between log GDP per capita and democracy across countries in 1999. However, this relationship is **not causal** once panel data methods are applied.
